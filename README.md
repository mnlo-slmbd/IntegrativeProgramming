# University Career Center Management System

Career Management System (CMS) is a software platform that helps students and career staff to manage the career development process. CMS can provide a variety of features, such as:

Student profile - it is associated in a profiling database of UNC graduates along with their career profile.
Job searching - this consists of job listing vacancies for UNC graduates inlined with their graduated program/course.
Track student progress - it indicates tracking of UNC graduates by monitoring their employability progress.

There are many benefits of using
 CMS for students, Career Center Office staff and college deans. One of its features is the creation of a student profile which contains his/her  personal data and his/her skills that can be used to apply for a job. Students can also use it to search for a job online and find out if their skills are suitable for their application. Career staff can use CMS to manage student appointments. Deans can use CMS to track student progress.
